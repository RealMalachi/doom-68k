**SGDK** is a free development kit allowing to develop software in **C language** for the **Sega Mega Drive**.
It contains the development library itself (with the code sources) and some custom tools used to compile resources.
SGDK uses the GCC compiler (m68k-elf target) and the libgcc to generate ROM image. Binaries (GCC 6.3) are provided for Windows OS for convenience but you need to install it by yourself for others operating systems.
Note that SGDK also requires Java (custom tools need it) so you need to have Java installed on your system.

SGDK library and custom tools are distributed under the MIT license (see [license.txt](license.txt) file).
GCC compiler and libgcc are under GNU license (GPL3) and any software build from it (as the SGDK library) is under the GCC runtime library exception license (see COPYING.RUNTIME file)
 
## GET STARTED

First, you need to know that SGDK uses C language (assembly is also possible but not necessary) so it's highly recommended to be familiar with C programming before trying to develop with SGDK. Learning C language at same time than learning 'Sega Mega Drive' programming is definitely too difficult and you will end nowhere. It's also important to have, at least, a basic knowledge about the Sega Mega Drive hardware (specifically the video system).

### INSTALLATION AND DOCUMENTATION 

Then when you feel ready you can go further and finally install SGDK :)

You can find installation instructions and tutorials about how use SGDK on the wiki:<br>
https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/wiki

Also SGDK comes with a doxygen documentation (generated from .h header files) which provides complete information about SGDK structures and functions description. You can find it in the _'doc'_ folder (open your local _doc/html/files.html_ in your browser).

Another important point to know is that SGDK heavily relies on _resources_ which are compiled through _rescomp_ tool. You can read the [rescomp.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/master/bin/rescomp.txt) file to know which kind of resource you can use and how to declare them then you can check the *'sample'* folder from SGDK and in particular the [sonic sample](https://github.com/Stephane-D/SGDK/tree/master/sample/sonic) which is a good showcase of SGDK usage in general (functions and resources).

### OTHERS TUTORIALS

You can also follow up-to-date and more complete online tutorials as this one (thanks to Ohsat for making them):<br>

You also have the great ones from Danibus (spanish only):<br>

## HELP AND SUPPORT

If you need help or support with SGDK, you can go to the Spritesmind forum which is dedicated to Sega Mega Drive development and has a specific section for SGDK:<br>
http://gendev.spritesmind.net/forum/

You can also join the SGDK Discord server to get support:<br>

### MACOSX / LINUX

Unix/Linux users should give a try to this very simple script allowing to use SGDK from Wine easily:<br>
https://github.com/Franticware/SGDK_wine

There is also the new and nice solution proposed by Daniel Valdivieso to use SGDK with VSCode under any OS using Wine:<br>
https://github.com/v4ld3r5/sgdk_vscode_template

An alternative solution for Unix/Linux is Gendev project from Kubilus:<br>
https://github.com/kubilus1/gendev<br>
But it seems to be outdated and is more complexe to setup than Wine based solution.

MacOSX users also have access to SGDK with Gendev for MacOS from Sonic3D project:<br>
https://github.com/SONIC3D/gendev-macos

### DOCKER

*A modern way to install it on any environement is to use Docker.*

To build the `sgdk` base image:

    docker build -t sgdk .

And then to compile the local env, such as `samples` for example:

    cd sample/sprite
    docker run --rm -v $PWD:/src sgdk

Note: `$PWD` will not work on Windows, there `%CD%` has to be used instead.

 
### VISUAL STUDIO

You can find a Visual Studio template into the 'vstudio' folder to facilate SGDK integration with VS.
To go even further you can also install the VS extension made by zerasul:<br>
